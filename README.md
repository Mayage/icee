# Ice-E Development Moved

Ice-E development has been moved to the [Ice](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice) repository. Pull requests targeting
future Ice-E (3.7 and higher) releases should be made there.

This repository remains for development of Ice-E 3.6 and as an archive for older Ice-E versions.
